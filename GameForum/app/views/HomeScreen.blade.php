        <p>My Name is Scott Deans and this is my tech/blog forum. This is where i come to put information about up and coming technologys and talk about them. I am a programmer who is a 4th year computer science student so sometimes i like to talk about different coding practices and new algorithms. Eventually this shall become a discusiion site where users can talk about up coming technologys for now  look at virtual and augmented reality a interesting field to get into.</p></div>
